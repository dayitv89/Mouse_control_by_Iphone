# Mouse_control_by_Iphone
Your mac mouse curser and left click, right click can handle by your iPhone screen touch

I'm using Node.js to run on mac osx and handle cursor actions. Currenlty I'm creating a webserver, I know prefer way is socket, but for testing purpose created simple http server. iPhone app handles single, double taps and pan gesture and sends that data to node.js server. 

Voila my testing code is working fine.
